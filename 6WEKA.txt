Step 1: Select the dataset “breast-cancer” and open it
Step 2: Check every attribute for missing values and visualizing each attribute
Step 2: Check every attribute for missing values and visualizing each attribute

REMOVING OUTLIERS FROM THE DATASET:
Steps involved are as follow:
Stepl: Select the dataset
Step 2: To detect the outliers, from “Filter” section go to unsupervised -> attribute ->
InterquartileRange and click on Apply
Step 2: To detect the outliers, from “Filter” section go to unsupervised -> attribute ->
InterquartileRange and click on Apply
After applying filter save the file with different name and compare the original and updated file after
removal of outliers
Step 4: To remove the outliers, Select the newly saved(updated) file where we added outliers and
Extreme Value attribute
Step 5: In the Filter section, go to unsupervised instance -> RemovewithValues
Step 5: In the Filter section, go to unsupervised instance -> RemovewithValues
Step 6: Check the attribute “Outlier” again. We can see that there are no attributes present in YES
label now. This indicates, we have successfully removed the outliers
